# IPA Generator (Python) 
Transcription of English Text into IPA

# EDIT: [Better version here](https://github.com/mphilli/English_to_IPA)


This program utilizes the Carnegie-Mellon University Phonetic Dictionary Database to convert English words into IPA. 
This program was created using PyDev (a Python plugin for the Eclipse IDE). 

a sample: 

    English Text to IPA Converter
    [English]: Hello World!
    multiple entries found: 
    [IPA]: [hɛloʊ wərld]
    [IPA]: [həloʊ wərld]
	
Why is this useful? 

IPA generators for the English language are decently abundant online; it is only in the manner of good practice that I 
have invented my own. I use the program for quick IPA conversions, as well as building other programs (such as a program that
calculates the frequency of different manners of articulation in a given text).
